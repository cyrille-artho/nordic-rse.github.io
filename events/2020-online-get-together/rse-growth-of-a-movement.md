# Research Software Engineering: growth of a movement

[[back to program](../)]

**Alys Brett**, UKAEA

14:10 CET, Monday, 30 November

The importance of Research Software Engineering as a role, a
discipline and a community is becoming more and more widely recognised
because it is essential for harnessing the opportunities and of
modern, computational research. Alys Brett is head of the Software
Engineering Group at the UK Atomic Energy Authority and founding
president of the Society for Research Software Engineering. She has
just handed over the leadership of the Society after several years in
that role. In this talk she will share the experience from the UK of
building recognition for the RSE role and developing groups, career
structures and communities, and reflect on where we are now with this
international movement.
